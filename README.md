# Data-prediction-and-plotting
###Objective:
The objective for this topic is to predict the third-semester pointers on the basis of the first and second-semester pointers values. And to create a method which can predict the near future data (one or two values) to its possible amount of accuracy by using the minimal amount of data.

###Approach:
1. The first approach is to apply linear regression to the give data set, but for applying that the data should be related. Yes, data here is not related as the semester changes subject weightage also changes credits assigned to them also changes as in the first year there were 27 credits and in second year 26 so if we apply linear regression to the data then the prediction values would be based on previous year's marks distribution pattern. 

2. So dropping the above idea, another approach is taken into consideration in this case it is assumed that the pointers will increase in a rectangular hyperbole fashion so as the distance between the pointers will follow the same trend but this theory ruled out because on plotting the rectangular hyperbole and the line joining the two pointers, intersect only at two points (i.e both line and rectangular hyperbole are almost parallel).

On x-axis pointers are plotted and on y-axis difference between the pointers are plotted.
